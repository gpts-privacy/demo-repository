## 📰 Project Overview

This project focuses on integrating **Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI)** to identify, map, and analyze vulnerabilities in climate and environmental health. Using open-source data and modern spatial computing techniques, the project visualizes how climate change, land use, and socioeconomic factors intersect in vulnerable communities.

📖 **Published Paper**  
Our project has been peer-reviewed and published in the journal *Applied Sciences* (MDPI):  
**[Climate Change Effects on Environmental Health in Vulnerable Communities](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/14/16/7091)**  
*Appl. Sci. 2024, 14(16), 7091. DOI: 10.3390/app14167091*
